we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.
In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or

Summary
1.1 What Is Psychology?
Psychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical
thinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.
1.2 History of Psychology
Before the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,
both Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,
which meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into
its component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.

demographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunities
among historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field will
increasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of the
future will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).
The Process of Scientific Research
Scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method. Basically, ideas (in the
form of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the real world (in the form of empirical observations), and
those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world, and so on. In this sense,
the scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In","The scientific method in psychology is a systematic approach used to acquire knowledge, often involving testing hypotheses and analyzing empirical evidence. It typically begins with posing a question or a problem, then proposing a hypothesis or theory to explain observed phenomena, conducting experiments to test the hypothesis, collecting and analyzing data, and finally drawing conclusions based on the results. This method ensures that findings are objective, reproducible, and grounded in observable reality. Through rigorous testing and verification, the scientific method aims to establish reliable causal relationships between variables and advance our understanding of complex behavioral and mental processes.

3.2 Cells of the Nervous System
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the basic parts of a neuron
• Describe how neurons communicate with each other
• Explain how drugs act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system
Psychologists striving to understand the human mind may study the nervous system. Learning how the body's
cells and organs function can help us understand the biological basis of human psychology. The nervous
system is composed of two basic cell types: glial cells (also known as glia) and neurons. Glial cells are
traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons, both physically and metabolically. Glial cells provide
scaffolding on which the nervous system is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow
neuronal communication, provide insulation to neurons, transport nutrients and waste products, and mediate

the other hand, serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the
nervous system. This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons.
Neuron Structure
Neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system, 100 billion strong at birth. Like all cells,
neurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function (Figure 3.8). A neuron’s outer
surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules
without an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged molecules.
FIGURE 3.8 This illustration shows a prototypical neuron, which is being myelinated by a glial cell.
The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma, or cell body. The soma has branching extensions known as
dendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are

what is referred to as a lock-and-key relationship—specific neurotransmitters fit specific receptors similar to
how a key fits a lock. The neurotransmitter binds to any receptor that it fits.
FIGURE 3.9 (a) The synaptic cleft is the space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrite of
another neuron. (b) In this pseudo-colored image from a scanning electron microscope, a terminal button (green)
has been opened to reveal the synaptic vesicles (orange and blue) inside. Each vesicle contains about 10,000
neurotransmitter molecules. (credit b: modification of work by Tina Carvalho, NIH-NIGMS; scale-bar data from Matt
Russell)
Neuronal Communication
Now that we have learned about the basic structures of the neuron and the role that these structures play in
neuronal communication, let’s take a closer look at the signal itself—how it moves through the neuron and then
jumps to the next neuron, where the process is repeated.

example, Eric Kandel has spent decades studying the synapse and its role in controlling the flow of information
through neural circuits needed to store memories (Mayford, Siegelbaum, & Kandel, 2012).
Many scientists believe that the entire brain is involved with memory. However, since Lashley’s research, other
scientists have been able to look more closely at the brain and memory. They have argued that memory is
located in specific parts of the brain, and specific neurons can be recognized for their involvement in forming
memories. The main parts of the brain involved with memory are the amygdala, the hippocampus, the
cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex (Figure 8.8).
8.2 • Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255

dendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are
received from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major
extension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttons
contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.
Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substance
known as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which the
signal travels. The myelin sheath is not continuous and there are small gaps that occur down the length of the
axon. These gaps in the myelin sheath are known as the Nodes of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is crucial for the
normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can be","Neurons consist of several different parts, including the outer surface membrane, the nucleus located in the cell body called the soma, and the dendrites.

3,"4.2 Sleep and Why We Sleep
We devote a very large portion of time to sleep, and our brains have complex systems that control various
aspects of sleep. Several hormones important for physical growth and maturation are secreted during sleep.
While the reason we sleep remains something of a mystery, there is some evidence to suggest that sleep is very
important to learning and memory.
4.3 Stages of Sleep
The different stages of sleep are characterized by the patterns of brain waves associated with each stage. As a
person transitions from being awake to falling asleep, alpha waves are replaced by theta waves. Sleep spindles
and K-complexes emerge in stage 2 sleep. Stage 3 and stage 4 are described as slow-wave sleep that is marked
by a predominance of delta waves. REM sleep involves rapid movements of the eyes, paralysis of voluntary
muscles, and dreaming. Both NREM and REM sleep appear to play important roles in learning and memory.

variability. As we begin to fall asleep, our brain wave activity changes. These changes can be visualized using
an EEG and are distinguished from one another by both the frequency and amplitude of the brain wave. The
frequency of a brain wave is how many brain waves occur in a second, and frequency is measured in Hertz
(Hz). Amplitude is the height of the brain wave (Figure 4.7). Sleep can be divided into two different general
phases: REM sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by darting
movements of the eyes under closed eyelids. Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves
during wakefulness. In contrast, non-REM (NREM) sleep is subdivided into three stages distinguished from
each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves. The first three stages of sleep are
NREM sleep, typically followed by REM sleep. In this section, we will discuss each of these stages of sleep and

NREM sleep, typically followed by REM sleep. In this section, we will discuss each of these stages of sleep and
their associated patterns of brain wave activity.

NREM Stages of Sleep
As we begin to fall asleep, we enter NREM sleep, and brain wave patterns decrease in frequency and increase
in amplitude. The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep. Stage 1 sleep is a transitional phase that
occurs between wakefulness and sleep, the period during which we drift off to sleep. During this time, there is
a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat. In addition, stage 1 sleep involves a marked

1. Stage 1: This is the transitional phase that occurs between wakefulness and sleep, where there is a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat. It lasts about 5 minutes.

2. Stage 2: Characterized by the appearance of sleep spindles, this stage represents the body's deep relaxation. It also features high-frequency brainwaves called theta waves.

3. Stage 3: Deep sleep, characterized by low frequency, high amplitude delta waves. Delta waves make up the largest part of this sleep cycle, accounting for about 60% of total sleep time. During this stage, an individual's heart rate and respiration slow dramatically, making it hard to wake them easily.

4. Stage 4: Also referred to as slow-wave sleep or deep sleep. It is when the body repairs itself, builds muscle tissue, and heals wounds. This stage is often associated with vivid dreams and is less common compared to the other stages.

known as Little Albert. His findings suggest that classical conditioning can explain how some fears develop.
6.3 Operant Conditioning
Operant conditioning is based on the work of B. F. Skinner. Operant conditioning is a form of learning in which
the motivation for a behavior happens after the behavior is demonstrated. An animal or a human receives a
consequence after performing a specific behavior. The consequence is either a reinforcer or a punisher. All
reinforcement (positive or negative) increases the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishment
(positive or negative) decreases the likelihood of a behavioral response. Several types of reinforcement
schedules are used to reward behavior depending on either a set or variable period of time.

trigger that same reflex? In operant conditioning, organisms learn, again, to associate events—a behavior and
its consequence (reinforcement or punishment). A pleasant consequence encourages more of that behavior in
the future, whereas a punishment deters the behavior. Imagine you are teaching your dog, Hodor, to sit. You

learning: classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning. Both classical and operant
conditioning are forms of associative learning where associations are made between events that occur
together. Observational learning is just as it sounds: learning by observing others.
6.2 Classical Conditioning
Pavlov’s pioneering work with dogs contributed greatly to what we know about learning. His experiments
explored the type of associative learning we now call classical conditioning. In classical conditioning,
organisms learn to associate events that repeatedly happen together, and researchers study how a reflexive
response to a stimulus can be mapped to a different stimulus—by training an association between the two
stimuli. Pavlov’s experiments show how stimulus-response bonds are formed. Watson, the founder of
behaviorism, was greatly influenced by Pavlov’s work. He tested humans by conditioning fear in an infant

In discussing operant conditioning, we use several everyday words—positive, negative, reinforcement, and
punishment—in a specialized manner. In operant conditioning, positive and negative do not mean good and
bad. Instead, positive means you are adding something, and negative means you are taking something away.
Reinforcement means you are increasing a behavior, and punishment means you are decreasing a behavior.
Reinforcement can be positive or negative, and punishment can also be positive or negative. All reinforcers
(positive or negative) increase the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishers (positive or negative)
decrease the likelihood of a behavioral response. Now let’s combine these four terms: positive reinforcement,
negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment (Table 6.2).

Psychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively
elicited, and it doesn’t account for new behaviors such as riding a bike. He proposed a theory about how such
behaviors come about. Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the","Operant conditioning is a form of learning in which the motivation for a behavior is determined by its consequences, whether positive or negative, reinforcing or punishing, thereby increasing or decreasing the likelihood of the behavior being performed in the future. It involves receiving a consequence after performing a specific action, including both reinforcement and punishment, to alter the frequency of the behavior exhibited. This approach contrasts with classical conditioning, which relies on unconditioned stimuli paired with neutral stimuli to elicit responses without prior learning. Operant conditioning uses reinforcement schedules to encourage desirable actions and punishment schedules to discourage undesirable ones, aiming to shape and modify learned behaviors through environmental feedback mechanisms.","219,193,219,205,204"

psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to
our experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and
often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led
some to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,
2003).
Cognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to
problem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.
Given such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various
concepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on
sensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and
therapy.

Schemata show up in social situations and routines of daily behavior.
7.2 Language
Language is a communication system that has both a lexicon and a system of grammar. Language acquisition
occurs naturally and effortlessly during the early stages of life, and this acquisition occurs in a predictable
sequence for individuals around the world. Language has a strong influence on thought, and the concept of
how language may influence cognition remains an area of study and debate in psychology.
7.3 Problem Solving
Many different strategies exist for solving problems. Typical strategies include trial and error, applying
algorithms, and using heuristics. To solve a large, complicated problem, it often helps to break the problem
into smaller steps that can be accomplished individually, leading to an overall solution. Roadblocks to problem
solving include a mental set, functional fixedness, and various biases that can cloud decision making skills.

Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think. It attempts to
explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking, emotion,
creativity, language, and problem solving, in addition to other cognitive processes. Cognitive psychologists
strive to determine and measure different types of intelligence, why some people are better at problem solving
than others, and how emotional intelligence affects success in the workplace, among countless other topics.

into meaningful categories of thought, which will be discussed later.

Storage
Once the information has been encoded, we have to somehow retain it. Our brains take the encoded
information and place it in storage. Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information.
In order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass through three distinct stages:
Sensory Memory, Short-Term Memory, and finally Long-Term Memory. These stages were first proposed by
Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin (1968). Their model of human memory (Figure 8.4), called Atkinson
and Shiffrin's model, is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer
processes information.

We can be at the heights of joy or in the depths of despair. We might feel angry when we are betrayed, fear
when we are threatened, and surprised when something unexpected happens. This section will outline some
of the most well-known theories explaining our emotional experience and provide insight into the biological
bases of emotion. This section closes with a discussion of the ubiquitous nature of facial expressions of
emotion and our abilities to recognize those expressions in others.
Theories of Emotion
Our emotional states are combinations of physiological arousal, psychological appraisal, and subjective
experiences. Together, these are the components of emotion, and our experiences, backgrounds, and cultures

• Understand the ubiquitous nature of producing and recognizing emotional expression
As we move through our daily lives, we experience a variety of emotions. An emotion is a subjective state of
being that we often describe as our feelings. Emotions result from the combination of subjective experience,
expression, cognitive appraisal, and physiological responses (Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen, & Ekman, 1991).
However, as discussed later in the chapter, the exact order in which the components occur is not clear, and
some parts may happen at the same time. An emotion often begins with a subjective (individual) experience,
which is a stimulus. Often the stimulus is external, but it does not have to be from the outside world. For
example, it might be that one thinks about war and becomes sad, even though they never experienced war.
Emotional expression refers to the way one displays an emotion and includes nonverbal and verbal behaviors

today and the most accurate approximation of the basic personality dimensions (Funder, 2001). The five
factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (Figure
11.14). A helpful way to remember the factors is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.
In the Five Factor Model, each person has each factor, but they occur along a spectrum. Openness to
experience is characterized by imagination, feelings, actions, and ideas. People who score high on this factor
tend to be curious and have a wide range of interests. Conscientiousness is characterized by competence, self-
discipline, thoughtfulness, and achievement-striving (goal-directed behavior). People who score high on this
factor are hardworking and dependable. Numerous studies have found a positive correlation between

behaving. They have identified important dimensions of personality. The Five Factor Model is the most widely
accepted theory today. The five factors are openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and
neuroticism. These factors occur along a continuum.

strength of personality traits varies across cultures. Individualist cultures and collectivist cultures place
emphasis on different basic values. People who live in individualist cultures tend to believe that independence,
competition, and personal achievement are important. People who live in collectivist cultures value social
harmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. There are three approaches that can be used

individuals. These five dimensions are known as the “Big Five” or the Five Factor model, and include
dimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each
of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,
Pulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,

FIGURE 11.13 The Eysencks described two factors to account for variations in our personalities: extroversion/
introversion and emotional stability/instability.
Later, the Eysencks added a third dimension: psychoticism versus superego control (Eysenck, Eysenck &
Barrett, 1985). In this dimension, people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers, cold,
nonconformists, impulsive, antisocial, and hostile, whereas people who are high on superego control tend to
have high impulse control—they are more altruistic, empathetic, cooperative, and conventional (Eysenck,
Eysenck & Barrett, 1985).
While Cattell’s 16 factors may be too broad, the Eysenck’s two-factor system has been criticized for being too
narrow. Another personality theory, called the Five Factor Model, effectively hits a middle ground, with its five
factors referred to as the Big Five personality factors.

12.1 What Is Social Psychology?
Social psychology is the subfield of psychology that studies the power of the situation to influence individuals’
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Psychologists categorize the causes of human behavior as those due to
internal factors, such as personality, or those due to external factors, such as cultural and other social
influences. Behavior is better explained, however, by using both approaches. Lay people tend to over-rely on
dispositional explanations for behavior and ignore the power of situational influences, a perspective called the
fundamental attribution error. People from individualistic cultures are more likely to display this bias versus
people from collectivistic cultures. Our explanations for our own and others behaviors can be biased due to not
having enough information about others’ motivations for behaviors and by providing explanations that bolster
our self-esteem.

As you’ve learned, social psychology is the study of how people affect one another’s thoughts, feelings, and
behaviors. We have discussed situational perspectives and social psychology’s emphasis on the ways in which
a person’s environment, including culture and other social influences, affect behavior. In this section, we
examine situational forces that have a strong influence on human behavior including social roles, social
norms, and scripts. We discuss how humans use the social environment as a source of information, or cues, on
how to behave. Situational influences on our behavior have important consequences, such as whether we will

Social Psychology
Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research
on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain
the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social
psychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and
patterns of thinking.

• Explain how the sociocultural model is used in therapy
• Discuss barriers to mental health services among ethnic minorities
The sociocultural perspective looks at you, your behaviors, and your symptoms in the context of your culture
and background. For example, José is an 18-year-old Hispanic male from a traditional family. José comes to
treatment because of depression. During the intake session, he reveals that he is gay and is nervous about
telling his family. He also discloses that he is concerned because his religious background has taught him that
being gay is wrong. How does his religious and cultural background affect him? How might his cultural
background affect how his family reacts if José were to tell them he is gay?
Mental health professionals must develop cultural competence (Figure 16.20), which means they must

identities to include individual, group, and universal dimensions, advocate the use of universal and culture-
specific strategies and roles in the healing process, and balances the importance of individualism and
collectivism in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of client and client systems (Sue, 2001).
This therapeutic perspective integrates the impact of cultural and social norms, starting at the beginning of
treatment. Therapists who use this perspective work with clients to obtain and integrate information about
their cultural patterns into a unique treatment approach based on their particular situation (Stewart,
Simmons, & Habibpour, 2012). Sociocultural therapy can include individual, group, family, and couples

to be high, around 40%–60% (McLellan, Lewis, & O’Brien, & Kleber, 2000). The goal of treatment is to help an
addict stop compulsive drug-seeking behaviors. Treatment usually includes behavioral therapy, which can
take place individually or in a group setting. Treatment may also include medication. Sometimes a person has
comorbid disorders, which usually means that they have a substance-related disorder diagnosis and another
psychiatric diagnosis, such as depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. The best treatment would
address both problems simultaneously.
16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization
The sociocultural perspective looks at you, your behaviors, and your symptoms in the context of your culture

Psychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical
thinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.
1.2 History of Psychology
Before the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,
both Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,
which meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into
its component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.

science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
Wundt and Structuralism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it “internal perception”), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism—that people have free will

William James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular
perspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism’s environment. Like
Wundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective
measures as well.
Sigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand
conscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias
and neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the
unconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.
Gestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and
his experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the

FIGURE 1.3 William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist.
Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory
Perhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology’s history was Sigmund Freud (Figure
1.4). Freud (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from “hysteria”
and neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of
symptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical
cause. Freud theorized that many of his patients’ problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud’s view,
the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to
the unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient’s problems. According to Freud,
the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came

The Historical Development of Industrial and Organizational Psychology
Industrial and organizational psychology had its origins in the early 20th century. Several influential early
psychologists studied issues that today would be categorized as industrial psychology: James Cattell
(1860–1944), Hugo Münsterberg (1863–1916), Walter Dill Scott (1869–1955), Robert Yerkes (1876–1956),
Walter Bingham (1880–1952), and Lillian Gilbreth (1878–1972). Cattell, Münsterberg, and Scott had been
students of Wilhelm Wundt, the father of experimental psychology. Some of these researchers had been
involved in work in the area of industrial psychology before World War I. Cattell’s contribution to industrial","Wilhelm Wundt and William James were two key figures in the development of psychology as a scientific field. Wundt was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist, and he founded structuralism, a method that aimed to break down thoughts into their smallest parts to better understand them. William James, on the other hand, was the first American psychologist and supported functionalism, which emphasized how mental processes serve specific functions in adapting organisms to their environments. Both scholars made significant contributions to the foundations of modern psychology.","20,20,42,22,463"

was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.
Functionalism
William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
They accepted Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
organism’s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
saw it, psychology’s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective

called the stages of psychosexual development. According to Freud, children’s pleasure-seeking urges are
focused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone, at each of the five stages of development:
oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital.
While most of Freud’s ideas have not found support in modern research, we cannot discount the contributions
that Freud has made to the field of psychology. Psychologists today dispute Freud's psychosexual stages as a

all of these ideas.
More modern iterations of Freud’s clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective (Knekt
et al., 2008; Shedler, 2010). Some current practices in psychotherapy involve examining unconscious aspects
of the self and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client. Freud’s
historical significance and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of the historical
movements within psychology.
Wertheimer, Koffka, Köhler, and Gestalt Psychology
Max Wertheimer (1880–1943), Kurt Koffka (1886–1941), and Wolfgang Köhler (1887–1967) were three
German psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany.
These scholars are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles.

role of a person’s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective
dominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).

the physiological arousal that the sight of the snake elicits will not feel fear.
A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable, or capable of being shown to be incorrect. Recall from the
introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors
(Figure 2.6). However, a major criticism of Freud’s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable; for
example, it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the id, the
ego, and the superego—the three elements of personality described in Freud’s theories. Despite this, Freud’s
theories are widely taught in introductory psychology texts because of their historical significance for
personality psychology and psychotherapy, and these remain the root of all modern forms of therapy.

Two additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity (or good continuation) and closure. The law of
continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous, smooth flowing lines rather than jagged,
broken lines (Figure 5.28). The principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into complete
objects rather than as a series of parts (Figure 5.29).

perceptual hypotheses: educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information. These
hypotheses are informed by a number of factors, including our personalities, experiences, and expectations.
We use these hypotheses to generate our perceptual set. For instance, research has demonstrated that those
who are given verbal priming produce a biased interpretation of complex ambiguous figures (Goolkasian &
Woodbury, 2010).

or as a pair of faces.
Another Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity. This
principle asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together, as Figure 5.26
illustrates.
FIGURE 5.26 The Gestalt principle of proximity suggests that you see (a) one block of dots on the left side and (b)
three columns on the right side.
How we read something provides another illustration of the proximity concept. For example, we read this
sentence like this, notl iket hiso rt hat. We group the letters of a given word together because there are no
spaces between the letters, and we perceive words because there are spaces between each word. Here are
some more examples: Cany oum akes enseo ft hiss entence? What doth es e wor dsmea n?
We might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields. According to this principle,

In the early part of the 20th century, Max Wertheimer published a paper demonstrating that individuals
perceived motion in rapidly flickering static images—an insight that came to him as he used a child’s toy
tachistoscope. Wertheimer, and his assistants Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka, who later became his
partners, believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli. This belief led to a
new movement within the field of psychology known as Gestalt psychology. The word gestalt literally means
form or pattern, but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts. In other words,
the brain creates a perception that is more than simply the sum of available sensory inputs, and it does so in","Gestalt principles refer to fundamental laws that help us understand how we perceive and organize patterns, shapes, and objects in the world around us. These principles include figure-ground relationships, grouping by proximity or similarity, the law of good continuation, and closure, which provide guidelines for organizing sensory information effectively. Understanding these principles aids in explaining human perception and helps in analyzing visual stimuli. They are central to Gestalt theory and influence our ability to interpret and categorize what we see. By applying these principles, individuals can better comprehend their surroundings through organized thinking processes.","186,181,182,180,179"

Pavlov (1849–1936), a Russian scientist, performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his
experiments in classical conditioning (Figure 6.3). As we discussed briefly in the previous section, classical
conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and, consequently, to anticipate events.

learning: classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning. Both classical and operant
conditioning are forms of associative learning where associations are made between events that occur
together. Observational learning is just as it sounds: learning by observing others.
6.2 Classical Conditioning
Pavlov’s pioneering work with dogs contributed greatly to what we know about learning. His experiments
explored the type of associative learning we now call classical conditioning. In classical conditioning,
organisms learn to associate events that repeatedly happen together, and researchers study how a reflexive
response to a stimulus can be mapped to a different stimulus—by training an association between the two
stimuli. Pavlov’s experiments show how stimulus-response bonds are formed. Watson, the founder of
behaviorism, was greatly influenced by Pavlov’s work. He tested humans by conditioning fear in an infant

General Processes in Classical Conditioning
Now that you know how classical conditioning works and have seen several examples, let’s take a look at some
of the general processes involved. In classical conditioning, the initial period of learning is known as
acquisition, when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus. During
acquisition, the neutral stimulus begins to elicit the conditioned response, and eventually the neutral stimulus
becomes a conditioned stimulus capable of eliciting the conditioned response by itself. Timing is important for
conditioning to occur. Typically, there should only be a brief interval between presentation of the conditioned
stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus. Depending on what is being conditioned, sometimes this interval is
as little as five seconds (Chance, 2009). However, with other types of conditioning, the interval can be up to
several hours.

times. Once the response to the second stimulus was “learned,” the food stimulus could be omitted. Pavlov’s
“classical conditioning” is only one form of learning behavior studied by behaviorists.

shortly). These situations include public transportation, open spaces (parking lots), enclosed spaces (stores),
crowds, or being outside the home alone (APA, 2013). About 1.4% of Americans experience agoraphobia
during their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005).
Acquisition of Phobias Through Learning
Many theories suggest that phobias develop through learning. Rachman (1977) proposed that phobias can be
acquired through three major learning pathways. The first pathway is through classical conditioning. As you
may recall, classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is paired with an
unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response (UCR), eliciting the same
response through its association with the unconditioned stimulus. The response is called a conditioned","Classical conditioning involves associating a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus to create a conditioned response. It's a form of learning where organisms learn to link two unrelated events, leading to a reflexive reaction to a new stimulus after repeated exposure to both stimuli together. This process was pioneered by Ivan Pavlov and has been pivotal in understanding how behaviors and responses are developed through association.","194,219,199,23,560"
17,"his experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the
United States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to
Gestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation
and perception.
One of the most influential schools of thought within psychology’s history was behaviorism. Behaviorism
focused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the
importance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and
B. F. Skinner’s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be
underestimated.
As behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become
dissatisfied with psychology’s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology

has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior.
B. F. Skinner (1904–1990) was an American psychologist (Figure 1.6). Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist,
and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences. Therefore, Skinner spoke of
reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research, Skinner
developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through
reinforcement and punishment. This device, known as an operant conditioning chamber (or more familiarly, a
Skinner box), has remained a crucial resource for researchers studying behavior (Thorne & Henley, 2005).

conditioning chamber, or Skinner box, are still widely used in research settings today. (credit a: modification of work

behavior. Indeed, Tolman (1938) stated, “I believe that everything important in psychology (except … such
matters as involve society and words) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and
theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze.”
FIGURE 1.5 John B. Watson is known as the father of behaviorism within psychology.
Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still be felt today
(Thorne & Henley, 2005). Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific
discipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation. In addition, it is used in behavioral
and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings. Behaviorism
has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior.
B. F. Skinner (1904–1990) was an American psychologist (Figure 1.6). Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist,

The Behavioral Perspective
Behaviorists do not believe in biological determinism: They do not see personality traits as inborn. Instead,
they view personality as significantly shaped by the reinforcements and consequences outside of the
organism. In other words, people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B. F. Skinner, a strict
behaviorist, believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior, including the enduring,
consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists.
As you may recall from your study on the psychology of learning, Skinner proposed that we demonstrate
consistent behavior patterns because we have developed certain response tendencies (Skinner, 1953). In other
words, we learn to behave in particular ways. We increase the behaviors that lead to positive consequences,
and we decrease the behaviors that lead to negative consequences. Skinner disagreed with Freud’s idea that

Summary
10.1 Motivation
Motivation to engage in a given behavior can come from internal and/or external factors. Multiple theories
have been put forward regarding motivation. More biologically oriented theories deal with the ways that
instincts and the need to maintain bodily homeostasis motivate behavior. Bandura postulated that our sense of
self-efficacy motivates behaviors, and there are a number of theories that focus on a variety of social motives.
Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a model that shows the relationship among multiple motives that
range from lower-level physiological needs to the very high level of self-actualization.

domains. For example, the need for achievement and recognition falls under the domain of ambition.
Dominance and aggression were recognized as needs under the domain of human power, and play was a
recognized need in the domain of interpersonal affection.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
While the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives, individual characteristics,
or social contexts, Abraham Maslow (1943) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motives
ranging from the biological to the individual to the social. These needs are often depicted as a pyramid (Figure
10.8).

you studied motivation, you learned about one of the best-known humanistic theories, Maslow's hierarchy of
needs theory, in which Maslow proposes that human beings have certain needs in common and that these
needs must be met in a certain order. The highest need is the need for self-actualization, which is the
achievement of our fullest potential. Maslow differentiated between needs that motivate us to fulfill something
that is missing and needs that inspire us to grow. He believed that many emotional and behavioral concerns
arise as a result of failing to meet these hierarchical needs.
Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers. One of Rogers’s main ideas about personality regards self-
concept, our thoughts and feelings about ourselves. How would you respond to the question, “Who am I?” Your
answer can show how you see yourself. If your response is primarily positive, then you tend to feel good about

has more recently addressed that late in life, Maslow proposed a self-transcendence level above self-
actualization—to represent striving for meaning and purpose beyond the concerns of oneself (Koltko-Rivera,
2006). For example, people sometimes make self-sacrifices in order to make a political statement or in an
attempt to improve the conditions of others. Mohandas K. Gandhi, a world-renowned advocate for
independence through nonviolent protest, on several occasions went on hunger strikes to protest a particular
situation. People may starve themselves or otherwise put themselves in danger displaying higher-level
motives beyond their own needs.

FIGURE 10.8 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is illustrated here. In some versions of the pyramid, cognitive and
aesthetic needs are also included between esteem and self-actualization. Others include another tier at the top of
the pyramid for self-transcendence.
At the base of the pyramid are all of the physiological needs that are necessary for survival. These are followed
by basic needs for security and safety, the need to be loved and to have a sense of belonging, and the need to
have self-worth and confidence. The top tier of the pyramid is self-actualization, which is a need that
essentially equates to achieving one’s full potential, and it can only be realized when needs lower on the
pyramid have been met. To Maslow and humanistic theorists, self-actualization reflects the humanistic
emphasis on positive aspects of human nature. Maslow suggested that this is an ongoing, life-long process and","Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a model that suggests that humans have different types of needs that must be satisfied in a specific order. The lowest level includes physiological needs such as food and shelter, while the uppermost tier represents self-actualization, which is the fulfillment of one's potential and is achieved once other needs are fulfilled. This model helps explain why individuals prioritize certain needs over others and provides a framework for understanding motivation and behavior. 327","365,337,388,338,338"

Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for
good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered
therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike
a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious
behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in
the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the
effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.
Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no

techniques of active listening, unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy to help clients
become more accepting of themselves.
Often in combination with psychotherapy, people can be prescribed biologically based treatments such as
psychotropic medications and/or other medical procedures such as electro-convulsive therapy.
16.3 Treatment Modalities
There are several modalities of treatment: individual therapy, group therapy, couples therapy, and family
therapy are the most common. In an individual therapy session, a client works one-on-one with a trained
therapist. In group therapy, usually 5–10 people meet with a trained group therapist to discuss a common
issue (e.g., divorce, grief, eating disorders, substance abuse, or anger management). Couples therapy involves

systematic desensitization form of exposure therapy used to treat phobias and anxiety disorders by exposing
a person to the feared object or situation through a stimulus hierarchy

which a client learns a new response to a stimulus that has previously elicited an undesirable behavior via
classical conditioning. Principles of operant conditioning can be applied to help people deal with a wide range
of psychological problems. Token economy is an example of a popular operant conditioning technique.
Cognitive therapy is a technique that focuses on how thoughts lead to feelings of distress. The idea behind
cognitive therapy is that how you think determines how you feel and act. Cognitive therapists help clients
change dysfunctional thoughts in order to relieve distress. Cognitive-behavioral therapy explores how our
thoughts affect our behavior. Cognitive-behavioral therapy aims to change cognitive distortions and self-
defeating behaviors.
Humanistic therapy focuses on helping people achieve their potential. One form of humanistic therapy
developed by Carl Rogers is known as client-centered or Rogerian therapy. Client-centered therapists use the

happening now, and gives tools to manage these moods on a daily basis. (Martin, 2007, n.p.)
Psychotherapy: Humanistic Therapy
Humanistic psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential. So it makes sense that the goal of
humanistic therapy is to help people become more self-aware and accepting of themselves. In contrast to
psychoanalysis, humanistic therapists focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts. They also
emphasize the patient’s present and future, as opposed to exploring the patient’s past.
Psychologist Carl Rogers developed a therapeutic orientation known as Rogerian, or client-centered therapy.
Note the change from patients to clients. Rogers (1951) felt that the term patient suggested the person seeking
help was sick and looking for a cure. Since this is a form of nondirective therapy, a therapeutic approach in
which the therapist does not give advice or provide interpretations but helps the person to identify conflicts","Client-centered therapy, often referred to as Rogerian therapy, is a therapeutic approach that emphasizes the acceptance and respect of the client's personal experience and growth. It utilizes techniques such as unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy to facilitate self-exploration and personal development.

This approach aims to build a strong relationship between the therapist and the client, fostering trust and mutual understanding. By creating a supportive environment where individuals feel safe and valued, client-centered therapy encourages clients to take control of their lives and improve their mental health and well-being.

often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led
some to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,

Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think. It attempts to
explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking, emotion,
creativity, language, and problem solving, in addition to other cognitive processes. Cognitive psychologists
strive to determine and measure different types of intelligence, why some people are better at problem solving
than others, and how emotional intelligence affects success in the workplace, among countless other topics.
They also sometimes focus on how we organize thoughts and information gathered from our environments
into meaningful categories of thought, which will be discussed later.

all factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.

same, but your perception can vary dramatically.

7.1 What Is Cognition?
In this section, you were introduced to cognitive psychology, which is the study of cognition, or the brain’s
ability to think, perceive, plan, analyze, and remember. Concepts and their corresponding prototypes help us
quickly organize our thinking by creating categories into which we can sort new information. We also develop
schemata, which are clusters of related concepts. Some schemata involve routines of thought and behavior,
and these help us function properly in various situations without having to “think twice” about them.
Schemata show up in social situations and routines of daily behavior.
7.2 Language
Language is a communication system that has both a lexicon and a system of grammar. Language acquisition

study cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate, organize, and utilize our conscious
cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing (for
example, Kahneman, 2011).
Cognition
Upon waking each morning, you begin thinking—contemplating the tasks that you must complete that day. In
what order should you run your errands? Should you go to the bank, the cleaners, or the grocery store first?
Can you get these things done before you head to class or will they need to wait until school is done? These
thoughts are one example of cognition at work. Exceptionally complex, cognition is an essential feature of
human consciousness, yet not all aspects of cognition are consciously experienced.

psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to
the physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,
social behavior, and other psychological attributes.
Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,
providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between
very young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very
young children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that

of these approaches in order to better understand how individuals change mentally and physically over time. These
methods include naturalistic observations, case studies, surveys, and experiments, among others.
Naturalistic observations involve observing behavior in its natural context. A developmental psychologist might

what extent is a child fundamentally different from the adult he grows up to be?
These are the types of questions developmental psychologists try to answer, by studying how humans change
and grow from conception through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and death. They view development as a
lifelong process that can be studied scientifically across three developmental domains—physical, cognitive,
and psychosocial development. Physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain, the
senses, motor skills, and health and wellness. Cognitive development involves learning, attention, memory,

to a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.

Biological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to
the area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how","Biopsychology is the branch of psychology that examines how biology impacts behavior. It combines aspects of psychology and physiology to explore relationships between the structure and function of the nervous system and behavior. Key concepts include understanding the influence of genes on behaviors through evolution and the integration of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors influencing health. Examples include studies on neurotransmitters, brain structures, and their roles in various psychological phenomena.","30,30,41,31,42"
23,"response, food preferences, mate selection, and cooperative behaviors (Confer et al., 2010).
Whereas evolutionary psychologists focus on universal patterns that evolved over millions of years, behavioral
geneticists study how individual differences arise, in the present, through the interaction of genes and the
environment. When studying human behavior, behavioral geneticists often employ twin and adoption studies to
research questions of interest. Twin studies compare the likelihood that a given behavioral trait is shared among
identical and fraternal twins; adoption studies compare those rates among biologically related relatives and
adopted relatives. Both approaches provide some insight into the relative importance of genes and environment
for the expression of a given trait.

Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations
and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that
spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and
men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective
mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations
in some cultures.

Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological
experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,

recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic
cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the
genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is
to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make
observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to
recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack
information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating
that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,
some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
(Confer et al., 2010).

through natural selection.
Two Perspectives on Genetics and Behavior
It’s easy to get confused about two fields that study the interaction of genes and the environment, such as the
fields of evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics. How can we tell them apart?
In both fields, it is understood that genes not only code for particular traits, but also contribute to certain
patterns of cognition and behavior. Evolutionary psychology focuses on how universal patterns of behavior and
cognitive processes have evolved over time. Therefore, variations in cognition and behavior would make
individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing those genes on to their offspring. Evolutionary
psychologists study a variety of psychological phenomena that may have evolved as adaptations, including fear

some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
(Confer et al., 2010).
One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under
environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what
these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits
need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about
which we can only hypothesize.
There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include
memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,
and status (Confer et al., 2010).
Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations","Evolutionary psychologists are interested in explaining why people behave in certain ways across different cultures and times, as well as predicting the outcomes of behaviors based on evolutionary theories. They aim to understand how innate biological traits interact with environmental influences to shape individual behaviors. Their primary goal is to uncover the mechanisms behind various psychological phenomena and adaptions that have developed over long periods of human evolution. Additionally, they seek to identify behaviors that could potentially confer an advantage in terms of survival and reproduction, even though the specific circumstances might differ greatly from contemporary settings. By comparing modern behaviors with historical ones, evolutionary psychologists hope to discern what has remained unchanged throughout millennia and what has been shaped by changing environments. Furthermore, they attempt to draw conclusions about what kinds of behaviors could lead to increased chances of passing genes onto future generations. While evolutionary psychology does involve observing and testing hypotheses using data from diverse populations, its ultimate focus remains on elucidating the origins and functions of observed behaviors.","85,31,31,84,31"

Summary
5.1 Sensation versus Perception
Sensation occurs when sensory receptors detect sensory stimuli. Perception involves the organization,
interpretation, and conscious experience of those sensations. All sensory systems have both absolute and
difference thresholds, which refer to the minimum amount of stimulus energy or the minimum amount of
difference in stimulus energy required to be detected about 50% of the time, respectively. Sensory adaptation,
selective attention, and signal detection theory can help explain what is perceived and what is not. In addition,
our perceptions are affected by a number of factors, including beliefs, values, prejudices, culture, and life
experiences.

Sensation
What does it mean to sense something? Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific
types of stimuli. When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor, sensation has occurred. For
example, light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye. These cells
relay messages, in the form of action potentials (as you learned when studying biopsychology), to the central
nervous system. The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction.

5Sensation and Perception","Sensation refers to the physical process of converting sensory stimulus energy into action potentials through transduction, while perception is the mental interpretation and conscious experience of these sensations. Both involve organizing and interpreting sensory inputs to create meaningful experiences, influenced by various factors such as personal beliefs and cultural background. Understanding sensation helps us comprehend the basis of perception, and vice versa, highlighting their interdependence in shaping our interactions with the world. [Reference: Context 4] To summarize, sensation is the raw data processing of external stimuli, while perception is the cognitive analysis and understanding of that data to create meaningful reality. [Reference: Context 5] In essence, sensation provides input, whereas perception interprets and organizes that input into comprehensible and meaningful experiences. [Reference: Context 1]

Sensation and Perception: A Comprehensive Overview

Sensation refers to the physical process of converting sensory stimulus energy into action potentials through transduction. It encompasses the conversion of external stimuli into electrical signals that travel along nerve fibers within the central nervous system. Sensory receptors, such as photoreceptors in the eyes and hair cells in the ears, convert light and sound waves into neural impulses that convey visual and auditory information to the brain. Each sensory system has its own range of sensitivity, termed the ""absolute threshold","185,158,157,31,156"

Sensations do not always lead to perceptions, especially if the stimuli remain constant over long periods. Additionally, sensory adaptation and selective attention can affect perceptual outcomes.

26,"FIGURE 1.12 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move
from infancy to adulthood.
While Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is
an increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This may be
reflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live
longer lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there
were just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this
number is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million
people in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).

TABLE 9.1
Cognitive Theory of Development
Jean Piaget (1896–1980) is another stage theorist who studied childhood development (Figure 9.5). Instead of
approaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective, Piaget focused on children’s
cognitive growth. He believed that thinking is a central aspect of development and that children are naturally
inquisitive. However, he said that children do not think and reason like adults (Piaget, 1930, 1932). His theory
of cognitive development holds that our cognitive abilities develop through specific stages, which exemplifies

psychosocial development. Erikson said that our social interactions and successful completion of social tasks
shape our sense of self. Jean Piaget proposed a theory of cognitive development that explains how children
think and reason as they move through various stages. Finally, Lawrence Kohlberg turned his attention to
moral development. He said that we pass through three levels of moral thinking that build on our cognitive
development.
9.3 Stages of Development
At conception the egg and sperm cell are united to form a zygote, which will begin to divide rapidly. This marks
the beginning of the first stage of prenatal development (germinal stage), which lasts about two weeks. Then
the zygote implants itself into the lining of the uterus, marking the beginning of the second stage of prenatal
development (embryonic stage), which lasts about six weeks. The embryo begins to develop body and organ

his schema for dogs. One day, Abdul sees a sheep for the first time and says, “Look mommy, dog!” Having a
basic schema that a dog is an animal with four legs and fur, Abdul thinks all furry, four-legged creatures are
dogs. When Abdul’s mom tells him that the animal he sees is a sheep, not a dog, Abdul must accommodate his
schema for dogs to include more information based on his new experiences. Abdul’s schema for dog was too
broad, since not all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs. He now modifies his schema for dogs and forms a
new one for sheep.
Like Freud and Erikson, Piaget thought development unfolds in a series of stages approximately associated
with age ranges. He proposed a theory of cognitive development that unfolds in four stages: sensorimotor,
preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational (Table 9.2).

solutions. In adolescence, a renewed egocentrism occurs. For example, a 15-year-old with a very small pimple
on her face might think it is huge and incredibly visible, under the mistaken impression that others must share
her perceptions.
Beyond Formal Operational Thought
As with other major contributors of theories of development, several of Piaget’s ideas have come under
criticism based on the results of further research. For example, several contemporary studies support a model
of development that is more continuous than Piaget’s discrete stages (Courage & Howe, 2002; Siegler, 2005,
2006). Many others suggest that children reach cognitive milestones earlier than Piaget describes (Baillargeon,
2004; de Hevia & Spelke, 2010).
According to Piaget, the highest level of cognitive development is formal operational thought, which develops
between 11 and 20 years old. However, many developmental psychologists disagree with Piaget, suggesting a","According to Jean Piaget, cognitive development occurs through specific stages such as sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. These stages represent different periods of cognitive development where individuals experience significant changes in their understanding and reasoning abilities. Piaget also emphasized the importance of innate curiosity and natural questioning abilities in developing cognition. His work challenged traditional views of learning, emphasizing that intelligence develops through structured environments and problem-solving processes rather than being predetermined. Through these stages, Piaget aimed to explain human cognitive progress and adaptability across different ages.","33,298,328,299,301"
27,"young children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that
physical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then
hide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden
object no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,
McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).

mouths to see if the items are edible, and once they can grasp objects, they may shake or bang them to see if
they make sounds. Between 5 and 8 months old, the child develops object permanence, which is the
understanding that even if something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, & Schilling, 2000).
According to Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight. Piaget
studied infants’ reactions when a toy was first shown to an infant and then hidden under a blanket. Infants
who had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it still
existed, whereas infants who had not developed object permanence would appear confused.

Developmental Psychology
Developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental
psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to
the physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,
social behavior, and other psychological attributes.
Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,
providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between
very young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very
young children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that

In Piaget’s view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to exhibit stranger
anxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people. Babies may demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a
stranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces such as parents.
Stranger anxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore,

inferior prefrontal cortex in the semantic task. In another study, encoding was associated with left frontal
activity, while retrieval of information was associated with the right frontal region (Craik et al., 1999).
Neurotransmitters
There also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory, such as epinephrine,
dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and acetylcholine (Myhrer, 2003). There continues to be discussion and
debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role (Blockland, 1996). Although
we don’t yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory, we do know that communication among
neurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories. Repeated activity by neurons leads to
increased neurotransmitters in the synapses and more efficient and more synaptic connections. This is how

Neurotransmitters and Drugs
There are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons, and we can speak in
broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters (Table 3.1). Much of what
psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in
psychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological
causes of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with
imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help
improve the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat
psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.

disorder than in major depressive disorder (Merikangas et al. 2011).
People with mood disorders often have imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, particularly norepinephrine
and serotonin (Thase, 2009). These neurotransmitters are important regulators of the bodily functions that are
disrupted in mood disorders, including appetite, sex drive, sleep, arousal, and mood. Medications that are
used to treat major depressive disorder typically boost serotonin and norepinephrine activity, whereas
lithium—used in the treatment of bipolar disorder—blocks norepinephrine activity at the synapses (Figure

dimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each
of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,
Pulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,
Jang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996).

Access for free at openstax.org

the Big Five factors are relatively stable over our lifespan, with some tendency for the factors to increase or
decrease slightly. Researchers have found that conscientiousness increases through young adulthood into
middle age, as we become better able to manage our personal relationships and careers (Donnellan & Lucas,
2008). Agreeableness also increases with age, peaking between 50 to 70 years (Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, &
Costa, 2005). Neuroticism and extroversion tend to decline slightly with age (Donnellan & Lucas; Terracciano
et al.). Additionally, The Big Five factors have been shown to exist across ethnicities, cultures, and ages, and
may have substantial biological and genetic components (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1996; Jang et al., 2006;
McCrae & Costa, 1997; Schmitt et al., 2007).
Another model of personality traits is the HEXACO model. HEXACO is an acronym for six broad traits: honesty-

factors referred to as the Big Five personality factors. It is the most popular theory in personality psychology
today and the most accurate approximation of the basic personality dimensions (Funder, 2001). The five
factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (Figure
11.14). A helpful way to remember the factors is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.
In the Five Factor Model, each person has each factor, but they occur along a spectrum. Openness to
experience is characterized by imagination, feelings, actions, and ideas. People who score high on this factor
tend to be curious and have a wide range of interests. Conscientiousness is characterized by competence, self-
discipline, thoughtfulness, and achievement-striving (goal-directed behavior). People who score high on this
factor are hardworking and dependable. Numerous studies have found a positive correlation between

FIGURE 11.13 The Eysencks described two factors to account for variations in our personalities: extroversion/
introversion and emotional stability/instability.
Later, the Eysencks added a third dimension: psychoticism versus superego control (Eysenck, Eysenck &
Barrett, 1985). In this dimension, people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers, cold,
nonconformists, impulsive, antisocial, and hostile, whereas people who are high on superego control tend to
have high impulse control—they are more altruistic, empathetic, cooperative, and conventional (Eysenck,
Eysenck & Barrett, 1985).
While Cattell’s 16 factors may be too broad, the Eysenck’s two-factor system has been criticized for being too
narrow. Another personality theory, called the Five Factor Model, effectively hits a middle ground, with its five
factors referred to as the Big Five personality factors. It is the most popular theory in personality psychology

The","The Big Five personality trait model is a widely accepted theoretical framework used to describe personality in terms of five distinct factors: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. This model provides a comprehensive view of individual differences in human behavior and preferences across various aspects of life.

Summary
15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?
Psychological disorders are conditions characterized by abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Although
challenging, it is essential for psychologists and mental health professionals to agree on what kinds of inner
experiences and behaviors constitute the presence of a psychological disorder. Inner experiences and
behaviors that are atypical or violate social norms could signify the presence of a disorder; however, each of
these criteria alone is inadequate. Harmful dysfunction describes the view that psychological disorders result
from the inability of an internal mechanism to perform its natural function. Many of the features of harmful
dysfunction conceptualization have been incorporated in the APA’s formal definition of psychological

15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Understand the problems inherent in defining the concept of psychological disorder
• Describe what is meant by harmful dysfunction
• Identify the formal criteria that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must meet to be considered abnormal and,
thus, symptomatic of a psychological disorder
According to the American Psychiatric Association, a psychological disorder, or mental disorder, is “a
syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation,
or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying
mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or
other important activities” (2013). Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders, including their

choice among U.S. mental health professionals, and this chapter is based on the DSM paradigm.
The Compassionate View of Psychological Disorders
As these disorders are outlined, please bear two things in mind. First, remember that psychological disorders
represent extremes of inner experience and behavior. If, while reading about these disorders, you feel that
these descriptions begin to personally characterize you, do not worry—this moment of enlightenment probably
means nothing more than you have had a range of experiences and emotions. Each of us experiences episodes
of sadness, anxiety, and preoccupation with certain thoughts—times when we do not quite feel ourselves.
These episodes should not be considered problematic unless the accompanying thoughts and behaviors
become extreme and have a disruptive effect on one’s life. Second, understand that people with psychological
disorders are far more than just embodiments of their disorders. We do not use terms such as schizophrenics,

Definition of a Psychological Disorder
Perhaps the simplest approach to conceptualizing psychological disorders is to label behaviors, thoughts, and
inner experiences that are atypical, distressful, dysfunctional, and sometimes even dangerous, as signs of a
disorder. For example, if you ask a classmate for a date and you are rejected, you probably would feel a little
dejected. Such feelings would be normal. If you felt extremely depressed—so much so that you lost interest in
activities, had difficulty eating or sleeping, felt utterly worthless, and contemplated suicide—your feelings
would be atypical, would deviate from the norm, and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder.
Just because something is atypical, however, does not necessarily mean it is disordered.
For example, only about 4% of people in the United States have red hair, so red hair is considered an atypical

These include syndromes characterized by clinically significant disturbance in cognitive functions, emotional regulation, or behavior, which reflect dysfunction in psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. They often involve significant distress in social, occupational, or other important activities, and are typically associated with disruptions in daily life. According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA), they represent extremes of inner experience and behavior, but also emphasize that individuals with these disorders are more than just embodying them. Distress and disruption are necessary indicators of psychological disorders. Atypical, distressful, dysfunctional, and potentially dangerous behaviors, thoughts, and feelings can be considered as symptoms of a disorder. However, a disorder requires more than just unusual experiences; harmful dysfunction refers to the belief that disorders arise due to the failure of internal mechanisms to perform their natural functions. This concept has influenced the APA's formal definition of psychological disorders. The introduction mentions that the term ""psychopathology"" encompasses the study of psychological disorders, including their diagnostic criteria. In summary, psychological disorders encompass both the presence of atypical experiences and behaviors, as well as the functional dysfunctions they entail.","602,549,556,549,10"

use a common language with others in the field and aids in communication about the disorder with the
patient, colleagues and the public. A proper diagnosis is an essential element to guide proper and successful
treatment. For these reasons, classification systems that organize psychological disorders systematically are
necessary.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
Although a number of classification systems have been developed over time, the one that is used by most
mental health professionals in the United States is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association (2013). (Note that the American Psychiatric

each described in detail, including its symptoms, prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity. Over time, the
number of diagnosable conditions listed in the DSM has grown steadily, prompting criticism from some.
Nevertheless, the diagnostic criteria in the DSM are more explicit than that of any other system, which makes
the DSM system highly desirable for both clinical diagnosis and research.

Association differs from the American Psychological Association; both are abbreviated APA.) The first edition
of the DSM, published in 1952, classified psychological disorders according to a format developed by the U.S.
Army during World War II (Clegg, 2012). In the years since, the DSM has undergone numerous revisions and
editions. The most recent edition, published in 2013, is the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). The DSM-5 includes many
categories of disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and dissociative disorders). Each
disorder is described in detail, including an overview of the disorder (diagnostic features), specific symptoms
required for diagnosis (diagnostic criteria), prevalence information (what percent of the population is thought
to be afflicted with the disorder), and risk factors associated with the disorder. Figure 15.4 shows lifetime

Psychologists report their research findings in peer-reviewed journal articles. Research published in this
format is checked by several other psychologists who serve as a filter separating ideas that are supported by
evidence from ideas that are not. Replication has an important role in ensuring the legitimacy of published
research. In the long run, only those findings that are capable of being replicated consistently will achieve
consensus in the scientific community.
2.4 Ethics
Ethics in research is an evolving field, and some practices that were accepted or tolerated in the past would be
considered unethical today. Researchers are expected to adhere to basic ethical guidelines when conducting
experiments that involve human participants. Any experiment involving human participants must be
approved by an IRB. Participation in experiments is voluntary and requires informed consent of the

received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or
more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or
harmed in any way, Milgram’s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates,
those who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have
clear, specific directions on how to behave during the research study (Hock, 2009). Milgram’s and others’
studies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development
of ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research
subjects, unless it can be argued not to cause harm and, in general, requiring informed consent of
participants.

Have you ever wondered whether the violence you see on television affects your behavior?
Are you more likely to behave aggressively in real life after watching people behave violently in dramatic
situations on the screen? Or, could seeing fictional violence actually get aggression out of your system, causing
you to be more peaceful? How are children influenced by the media they are exposed to? A psychologist
interested in the relationship between behavior and exposure to violent images might ask these very
questions.

Thus, ethical considerations play a crucial role in establishing the foundation upon which psychological studies are built.","76,35,67,6,46"

The Cognitive Revolution
Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).

FIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the
same, but your perception can vary dramatically.
As described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our
experience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)
together. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,
our previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.
Cognitive Psychology
As mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus
their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive
psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to

Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
2005).
Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928–), an American linguist, was
dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology’s focus on
behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).

Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the

European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).

influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology","The cognitive revolution in psychology emerged during the mid-20th century when new perspectives from linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. It was initiated by the cognitive psychology textbooks published in the late 1950s, such as ""Cognitive Psychology"" by Ulric Neisser, which became foundational texts in the field. The cognitive revolution emphasized the study of cognition, including thoughts and mental processes, rather than focusing solely on behavior. This shift aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of psychological phenomena by integrating insights from various disciplines. Key figures like Noam Chomsky's dissatisfaction with behaviorism's narrow focus contributed significantly to this change. The cognitive revolution also facilitated cooperation between psychologists and researchers from related fields, leading to the emergence of the cognitive sciences.","27,32,27,20,27"

realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.

developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a “womanless” psychology
(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
sufficient interest to study.
An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the

prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
scientific approach to knowledge.

graduation. A significant population of non-traditional college students may face additional stressors, such as
raising children or holding down a full-time job while working toward a degree.
Of course, life is filled with many additional challenges beyond those incurred in college or the workplace. We
might have concerns with financial security, difficulties with friends or neighbors, family responsibilities, and
we may not have enough time to do the things we want to do. Even minor hassles—losing things, traffic jams,
and loss of internet service—all involve pressure and demands that can make life seem like a struggle and that
can compromise our sense of well-being. That is, all can be stressful in some way.
Scientific interest in stress, including how we adapt and cope, has been longstanding in psychology; indeed,
after nearly a century of research on the topic, much has been learned and many insights have been

threatening to one’s well-being. The scientific study of how stress and emotional factors impact health and
well-being is called health psychology, a field devoted to studying the general impact of psychological factors
on health. The body’s primary physiological response during stress, the fight-or-flight response, was first
identified in the early 20th century by Walter Cannon. The fight-or-flight response involves the coordinated
activity of both the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Hans
Selye, a noted endocrinologist, referred to these physiological reactions to stress as part of general adaptation
syndrome, which occurs in three stages: alarm reaction (fight-or-flight reactions begin), resistance (the body
begins to adapt to continuing stress), and exhaustion (adaptive energy is depleted, and stress begins to take a
physical toll).

The term stress as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the 1930s, but it did
not enter the popular vernacular until the 1970s (Lyon, 2012). Today, we often use the term loosely in
describing a variety of unpleasant feeling states; for example, we often say we are stressed out when we feel
frustrated, angry, conflicted, overwhelmed, or fatigued. Despite the widespread use of the term, stress is a
fairly vague concept that is difficult to define with precision.","Stress in psychology refers to a process where an individual perceives and reacts to perceived threats or pressures, leading to physiological, cognitive, and behavioral responses.

Stages of Psychosexual Development
Freud believed that personality develops during early childhood: Childhood experiences shape our
personalities as well as our behavior as adults. He asserted that we develop via a series of stages during
childhood. Each of us must pass through these childhood stages, and if we do not have the proper nurturing
and parenting during a stage, we will be stuck, or fixated, in that stage, even as adults.
In each psychosexual stage of development, the child’s pleasure-seeking urges, coming from the id, are
focused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone. The stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, and
genital (Table 11.1).
Freud’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial. To understand the origins of the theory, it is

nurturance and parenting during a stage, we may become stuck, or fixated, in that stage. Freud’s stages are
called the stages of psychosexual development. According to Freud, children’s pleasure-seeking urges are
focused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone, at each of the five stages of development:
oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital.
While most of Freud’s ideas have not found support in modern research, we cannot discount the contributions
that Freud has made to the field of psychology. Psychologists today dispute Freud's psychosexual stages as a
legitimate explanation for how one's personality develops, but what we can take away from Freud’s theory is

genital (Table 11.1).
Freud’s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial. To understand the origins of the theory, it is
helpful to be familiar with the political, social, and cultural influences of Freud’s day in Vienna at the turn of
the 20th century. During this era, a climate of sexual repression, combined with limited understanding and
education surrounding human sexuality, heavily influenced Freud’s perspective. Given that sex was a taboo
topic, Freud assumed that negative emotional states (neuroses) stemmed from suppression of unconscious
sexual and aggressive urges. For Freud, his own recollections and interpretations of patients’ experiences and
dreams were sufficient proof that psychosexual stages were universal events in early childhood.

These stages are characterized by specific erogenous zones where a child's pleasure-seeking urges are focused, leading to conflicts and fixation points that affect adult personality. The final conflict often occurs at the genital stage, and fixation at any point during the process results in a lasting impact on adulthood. Freud's theories suggest that unresolved conflicts during these stages lead to neuroses and later psychological issues. While some aspects of his work are debated, his foundational concepts about the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping personality remain influential in psychology.","377,295,377,402,402"

Psychologists report their research findings in peer-reviewed journal articles. Research published in this
format is checked by several other psychologists who serve as a filter separating ideas that are supported by
evidence from ideas that are not. Replication has an important role in ensuring the legitimacy of published
research. In the long run, only those findings that are capable of being replicated consistently will achieve
consensus in the scientific community.
2.4 Ethics
Ethics in research is an evolving field, and some practices that were accepted or tolerated in the past would be
considered unethical today. Researchers are expected to adhere to basic ethical guidelines when conducting
experiments that involve human participants. Any experiment involving human participants must be
approved by an IRB. Participation in experiments is voluntary and requires informed consent of the

replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding. In any case, each replication
serves to provide more evidence to support the original research findings. Successful replications of published
research make scientists more apt to adopt those findings, while repeated failures tend to cast doubt on the
legitimacy of the original article and lead scientists to look elsewhere. For example, it would be a major
advancement in the medical field if a published study indicated that taking a new drug helped individuals
achieve a healthy weight without changing their diet. But if other scientists could not replicate the results, the
original study’s claims would be questioned.
In recent years, there has been increasing concern about a “replication crisis” that has affected a number of
scientific fields, including psychology. Some of the most well-known studies and scientists have produced

literature and, to some extent, ensures that each research article provides new information. Ultimately, the
journal editor will compile all of the peer reviewer feedback and determine whether the article will be
published in its current state (a rare occurrence), published with revisions, or not accepted for publication.
Peer review provides some degree of quality control for psychological research. Poorly conceived or executed
studies can be weeded out, and even well-designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested. Peer
review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it,
meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability. Sometimes
replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding. In any case, each replication

Diversity, representation, and inclusion
With the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has
engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked
to follow a framework to evaluate the book’s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field,
photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse
groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is
available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.

It serves as a rigorous check against potential biases, errors, or misinterpretations, thereby safeguarding the integrity of scientific inquiry. By requiring experiments to be independently verified multiple times, replication helps establish that a result is truly replicable under consistent conditions, thus building consensus within the scientific community. This process enhances the trustworthiness of published research, enabling other scholars to build upon these findings through further experimentation and validation. Additionally, replication allows for the expansion of knowledge by providing robust data points that can either confirm or refute initial hypotheses, ultimately contributing to the evolution and refinement of psychological theories and methodologies.","76,68,647,68,14"

Two types of therapy are psychotherapy and biomedical therapy. Both types of treatment help people with
mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Psychotherapy is a psychological
treatment that employs various methods to help someone overcome personal problems, or to attain personal
growth. In modern practice, it has evolved into what is known as psychodynamic therapy, which will be
discussed later. Biomedical therapy involves medication and/or medical procedures to treat psychological
disorders. First, we will explore the various psychotherapeutic orientations outlined in Table 16.1 (many of
these orientations were discussed in the Introduction chapter).

16.2 Types of Treatment
Psychoanalysis was developed by Sigmund Freud. Freud’s theory is that a person’s psychological problems are
the result of repressed impulses or childhood trauma. The goal of the therapist is to help a person uncover
buried feelings by using techniques such as free association and dream analysis.
Play therapy is a psychodynamic therapy technique often used with children. The idea is that children play out
their hopes, fantasies, and traumas, using dolls, stuffed animals, and sandbox figurines.

determines the success of treatment is the person’s relationship with the psychologist or therapist.
Biomedical Therapies
Individuals can be prescribed biologically based treatments or psychotropic medications that are used to treat
mental disorders. While these are often used in combination with psychotherapy, they also are taken by
individuals not in therapy. This is known as biomedical therapy. Medications used to treat psychological
disorders are called psychotropic medications and are prescribed by medical doctors, including psychiatrists.
In Louisiana and New Mexico, psychologists are able to prescribe some types of these medications (American
Psychological Association, 2014).
Different types and classes of medications are prescribed for different disorders.

41,"Neurotransmitters and Drugs
There are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons, and we can speak in
broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters (Table 3.1). Much of what
psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in
psychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological
causes of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with
imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help
improve the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat
psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.

disorder than in major depressive disorder (Merikangas et al. 2011).
People with mood disorders often have imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, particularly norepinephrine
and serotonin (Thase, 2009). These neurotransmitters are important regulators of the bodily functions that are
disrupted in mood disorders, including appetite, sex drive, sleep, arousal, and mood. Medications that are
used to treat major depressive disorder typically boost serotonin and norepinephrine activity, whereas
lithium—used in the treatment of bipolar disorder—blocks norepinephrine activity at the synapses (Figure

inferior prefrontal cortex in the semantic task. In another study, encoding was associated with left frontal
activity, while retrieval of information was associated with the right frontal region (Craik et al., 1999).
Neurotransmitters
There also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory, such as epinephrine,
dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and acetylcholine (Myhrer, 2003). There continues to be discussion and
debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role (Blockland, 1996). Although
we don’t yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory, we do know that communication among
neurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories. Repeated activity by neurons leads to
increased neurotransmitters in the synapses and more efficient and more synaptic connections. This is how

Industrial-Organizational Psychology
Industrial-Organizational psychology (I-O psychology) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological
theories, principles, and research findings in industrial and organizational settings. I-O psychologists are often
involved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure, and workplace environment.
Businesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create an
environment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency. In addition to its applied
nature, I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings (Riggio,
2013).

Chicago, Western Electric’s Hawthorne Works (Figure 13.4). This long-term project took industrial psychology
beyond just employee selection and placement to a study of more complex problems of interpersonal
relations, motivation, and organizational dynamics. These studies mark the origin of organizational

more time on with an average of about 43–62 hours per week. The workday is a significant portion of workers’
time and energy. It impacts their lives and their family’s lives in positive and negative physical and
psychological ways. Industrial and organizational (I-O) psychology is a branch of psychology that studies
how human behavior and psychology affect work and how they are affected by work.
Industrial and organizational psychologists work in four main contexts: academia, government, consulting

Summary
13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology?
The field of I-O psychology had its birth in industrial psychology and the use of psychological concepts to aid in
personnel selection. However, with research such as the Hawthorne study, it was found that productivity was
affected more by human interaction and not physical factors; the field of industrial psychology expanded to
include organizational psychology. Both WWI and WWII had a strong influence on the development of an
expansion of industrial psychology in the United States and elsewhere: The tasks the psychologists were
assigned led to development of tests and research in how the psychological concepts could assist industry and
other areas. This movement aided in expanding industrial psychology to include organizational psychology.

referred to as ergonomics.

our self-esteem.
12.2 Self-presentation
Human behavior is largely influenced by our social roles, norms, and scripts. In order to know how to act in a
given situation, we have shared cultural knowledge of how to behave depending on our role in society. Social
norms dictate the behavior that is appropriate or inappropriate for each role. Each social role has scripts that
help humans learn the sequence of appropriate behaviors in a given setting. The famous Stanford prison
experiment is an example of how the power of the situation can dictate the social roles, norms, and scripts we
follow in a given situation, even if this behavior is contrary to our typical behavior.
12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion
Attitudes are our evaluations or feelings toward a person, idea, or object and typically are positive or negative.

Social Norms
As discussed previously, social roles are defined by a culture’s shared knowledge of what is expected behavior
of an individual in a specific role. This shared knowledge comes from social norms. A social norm is a group’s
expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members—how they are supposed to behave
and think (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955; Berkowitz, 2004). How are we expected to act? What are we expected to
talk about? What are we expected to wear? In our discussion of social roles we noted that colleges have social
norms for students’ behavior in the role of student and workplaces have social norms for employees’ behaviors
in the role of employee. Social norms are everywhere including in families, gangs, and on social media outlets.

They provide shared expectations and guidelines within a community, helping individuals understand appropriate conduct in various situations. These norms are established through collective agreements and shared understanding among members of a group or society. By adhering to these norms, individuals ensure they behave appropriately and contribute positively to their communities. Furthermore, social norms help regulate behavior across different domains such as work, education, family life, and leisure activities, ensuring consistency and predictability in interactions. They serve as internalized standards that guide personal actions and societal dynamics. 

Key points emphasized include:
- Shared knowledge of expected behavior
- Influence on individual actions and decisions 
- Importance in maintaining social harmony and cohesion
- Role in creating a framework for interaction and cooperation. 

The examples provided in context 2 further illustrate the practical application of social norms, showing how they govern behavior in everyday settings like schools, workplaces, and online platforms like Instagram. Thus, social norms form the bedrock upon which much of human behavior is built and sustained. They not only dictate appropriate actions but also encourage adherence to certain values and moral standards within a community.","450,418,417,449,452"

Understanding Prejudice and Discrimination
As we discussed in the opening story of Trayvon Martin, humans are very diverse and although we share many
similarities, we also have many differences. The social groups we belong to help form our identities (Tajfel,
1974). These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile, which may lead to prejudice toward
people who are different. Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on
one’s membership in a particular social group (Allport, 1954; Brown, 2010). Prejudice is common against
people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group. Thus, certain types of education, contact,

making process that results from cohesive group members trying to maintain group harmony. Group
situations can improve human behavior through facilitating performance on easy tasks, but inhibiting
performance on difficult tasks. The presence of others can also lead to social loafing when individual efforts
cannot be evaluated.
12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination
As diverse individuals, humans can experience conflict when interacting with people who are different from
each other. Prejudice, or negative feelings and evaluations, is common when people are from a different social
group (i.e., out-group). Negative attitudes toward out-groups can lead to discrimination. Prejudice and
discrimination against others can be based on gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, or a
variety of other social identities. In-group’s who feel threatened may blame the out-groups for their plight, thus
using the out-group as a scapegoat for their frustration.

they view themselves and their own capabilities. Whether or not you agree with a stereotype, stereotypes are
generally well-known within a given culture (Devine, 1989).
Sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people, and this behavior is known
as discrimination. Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one’s membership in a
particular group (Allport, 1954; Dovidio & Gaertner, 2004). As a result of holding negative beliefs (stereotypes)
and negative attitudes (prejudice) about a particular group, people often treat the target of prejudice poorly,
such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends. In this way, discrimination is a form of oppression.
An example of a psychologist experiencing gender discrimination is found in the life and studies of Mary
Whiton Calkins. Calkins was given special permission to attend graduate seminars at Harvard (at that time in

Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of
study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She

Kenneth and Mamie Clark were pioneering psychologists responsible for the first psychological study used in a
Supreme Court case. Their research with African American children and doll choices was used to highlight the
harmful effects of segregation and provided support for the Browns and the NAACP in their lawsuit against the
Board of Education. The finding that African American children were more likely to choose a White doll over a
Black doll, in both northern and southern states, led them to theorize that the children did not have a healthy
concept of themselves (Clark & Clark, 1950).
The Clarks’ research differed from that of Inez Beverly Prosser, who also studied African American children in
segregated and integrated schools in Cincinnati. Parents could choose either environment for their children
during the 1930s. She found, among other factors, that the self-concept of children at segregated schools was","Key takeaways include highlighting harmful effects of segregation, supporting the Browns and NAACP, and suggesting that African American children do not have a healthy concept of themselves due to segregated environments.","49,28,49,29,315"
46,"extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world. As specific
hypotheses are tested, theories are modified and refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these tests
Figure 2.5.
FIGURE 2.5 The scientific method involves deriving hypotheses from theories and then testing those hypotheses. If
the results are consistent with the theory, then the theory is supported. If the results are not consistent, then the
theory should be modified and new hypotheses will be generated.
To see how this process works, let’s consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated from
that theory. As you’ll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotional
experience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state. If you walked out of your
home and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin to race and

about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.
Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,

the scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In
deductive reasoning, ideas are tested in the real world; in inductive reasoning, real-world observations lead
to new ideas (Figure 2.4). These processes are inseparable, like inhaling and exhaling, but different research
approaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects.
FIGURE 2.4 Psychological research relies on both inductive and deductive reasoning.
In the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization—one hypothesis—that is then used
to reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusions
reached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. A deductive reasoning argument might go

demographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunities
among historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field will
increasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of the
future will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).
The Process of Scientific Research
Scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method. Basically, ideas (in the
form of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the real world (in the form of empirical observations), and
those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world, and so on. In this sense,
the scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In

something like this: All living things require energy to survive (this would be your hypothesis). Ducks are living
things. Therefore, ducks require energy to survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis is
correct; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a
logical but incorrect conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability to see. Quackers is
a duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically
test their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers might design a study to test the
hypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy to
survive.
Deductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however,
inductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to","The scientific process of hypothesis testing involves deriving hypotheses from theories and then testing them through experiments. If the results are consistent with the theory, the theory is supported; otherwise, the theory needs modification and new hypotheses are generated. This cycle continues until the theory is deemed sufficiently accurate based on experimental evidence. Essentially, it's a feedback loop where theories evolve based on empirical data. Figure 2.5 illustrates this process. 

This summary captures the essence of how hypotheses are derived from theories in science, the role of experimentation, and how theories are revised based on empirical results. It highlights the iterative nature of scientific inquiry. 

Note: The reference to ""emotional experience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state"" in Context 1 seems unrelated to the broader scientific method described here and appears to be an example of how a particular scientific theory could be applied. It does not directly relate to the scientific method itself. The provided text focuses primarily on the scientific method rather than specific theories or emotions.","51,19,50,50,50"
47,"An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing “facts,”
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.

western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists

prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: “We must start with the
realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
womanly companions of men and to be mothers.” Weisstein’s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
knowledge of the psychology of women.
Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the

Before the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,
both Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,
which meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into
its component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.
